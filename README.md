# Amazon Clone
This is a clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to create a functional and visually appealing e-commerce platform that mimics the core features and design of the Amazon website. In the future, I plan to enhance the project by integrating React to add more interactivity and dynamic functionality.
